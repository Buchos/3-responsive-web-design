# 3-responsive-web-design  
This was an exercice for BeCode, we had to create a simple HTML/CSS page with 3 div and then make it behave   
according to the responsive web design so, displaying the div's differently according to the display size.   
here's the result : https://buchos.github.io/3-responsive-web-design/       
(resize the window or use CTRL+MAJ+I to see the responsive in action!)
